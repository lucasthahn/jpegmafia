His entrance demonstrates everything you need to know about him. To a packed standing room audience at the Pitchfork Music Festival in 2019, he emerges alone from backstage looking more like an introverted Google software engineer than a world-renowned rapper, hoodie up and backpack in tow. As the audience thunderously chants his name - Peggy! Peggy! Peggy! Peggy! - he’s hunched over behind a DJ’s table, typing his password into his laptop keyboard and pulling up an Ableton session. Now sauntering out from behind the audio gear, we get a better look at his gait; the tech-worker aesthetic gives way to that of a boxer entering the ring for a championship bout. Finally breaking the tension, he gives himself an introduction: “My name is JPEG-motherfucking-MAFIA, and I put on my good corduroys just for y’all.” One more trip back to the computer to start the beat, and he’s off; his first bar is delivered as a scream while he sprints across the stage.

This is exactly who JPEGMAFIA is: a restless tinkerer who can’t be tied down to one particular sound or aesthetic. He’s just as comfortable rapping with a hypermodern, triplety screamo-influenced flow over glitchy distorted beats as he is vibing on samples stitched together from the 1970s. His music deals in raw, unbridled energy, and his performance practices mirror his love for sonic chaos. He screams until his voice is raw, delivers bars while gyrating on the ground, and jumps fearlessly into the audience to crowdsurf, yet somehow has the stamina constantly run around the stage all the while. In the moments where he must briefly stop to catch his breath, he scales back the pandemonium to reveal a sly, deadpan sense of humor. While cheeky, his comment about “putting on [his] good corduroys” for the crowd aptly summarizes his musical philosophy. He's experimental and willing to take creative risks, but packages these risks in such a way that they never obscure the energy that his music aims to convey. At the risk of oversimplifying the breadth of his music, I’ll analyze JPEGMAFIA’s performance within the context of three basic categories, or vibes: screamo-trap, glitchy electronica, and retro-soul.

## Part 1: Screamo-Trap

JPEGMAFIA’s affinity for music with an aggressive, distorted tilt is clearly on display with his first song of the concert, a Denzel Curry track entitled “VENGEANCE.” “VENGEANCE” is designed to punch you directly in the mouth; it’s a medium-tempo trap beat driven by distorted, deep 808 bass tones contrasted with a smooth, sine wave ostinato in the higher register sounding out a tritone to create harmonic tension. Lyrically, it’s consistent with other “internet rap” songs in that it focuses on the macabre with allusions to violence, revenge, and gore, making frequent allusions to popular 2000s TV shows and cartoons. As in the original recording of the track, Curry’s verse comes first, and Peggy allows its first half to play uninterrupted before joining in. On the line “Cause I go hard like Timmy!” (likely a reference to the South Park character), he joins in, doubling Curry at a scream to create a multilayered textural effect. In a live setting, JPEGMAFIA relies on his “screamo” voice much more than he does in the studio, likely because it ramps up the energy of the performance and gets the crowd more involved.

Another tactic that allows Peggy to so successfully pull off the screamo-trap aesthetic is his own body. One instant he’ll have a calm, collected demeanor, but in the blink of an eye he’ll snap his upper body and neck to become a man possessed, only to return to his resting state just as quickly as he left it. While many rappers might gesticulate with their hands, or lightly bounce their knees at the end of phrases while they perform, JPEGMAFIA here takes this practice to its logical extreme, utilizing the full range of motion of his hips, knees, and torso to visually mark his flows. These wild, exaggerated movements also allow him to showcase his fatigue for dramatic effect; as he occasionally bends over, crawls on the ground, or gasps for air in the middle of a phrase, it’s impossible to question his dedication to his craft.

Approximately halfway through the concert we’re treated to “Panic Emoji,” another screamo-trap track which sees Peggy once again employ distorted 808s vocals to encourage the audience to dance. “KEEP HUSTLING. KEEP MOVING,” he yells after motioning the audience to make space for him to jump into the fray - the tempo is slow enough that the most enthusiastic crowd-members can time their jumps to the beat. At first he violently pinballs off of various spectators, but eventually they close in around him and he’s lost in a sea of heads bobbing up and down in a moment of collective aggressive catharsis.
